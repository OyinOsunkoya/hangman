### Project Title
Hangman game

### Description
A simple game that allows the user to guess a word which is randomly selected from a text document called "sowpods.txt".
The only clue the user gets is how many letters the word contains.
The correctly guessed letters in the word are shown to the user after each guess, to ease comprehension.
The game ends after 5 wrong guesses, and the user gets to see the word.
